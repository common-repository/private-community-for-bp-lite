== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Why is my private pages not redirecting to the redirect page?

A: You need to define the slug in Dashboard/Settings/PrivateCommunityBP/ Define Your Redirect Slug

Q: How can I unblock a post?

A: You can unblock a post using the slug of the post just like you would a page or alternatively
   you can use the post ID. I recommend using <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/reveal-ids-for-wp-admin-25/">Reveal IDs</a>
   to simplify the process of finding the ID of a post.
   
Q: How can I unblock an entire category?

A: You can't with the free version but I have a version that offers this flexibility for a reasonable fee.
   To purchase it contact me <a href="http://bphelpblog.wordpress.com/submit-comments-tips-or-tricks-or-job-inqueries/">here</a>

Q: Can I use this on a multisite installation?

A: This version is not tested for use with multisite Installations.

Q: Can I unblock sub-pages of forums and groups

A: No you can't at the moment but maybe in a future update.

Q: Why can't I unblock profiles to logged out visitors?

A: It would defeat the purpose of this plugin.
